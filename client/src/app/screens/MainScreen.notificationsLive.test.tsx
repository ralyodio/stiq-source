/**
 * The notification center used to snapshot onGetNotifications() ONCE at open time
 * (openNotifications, MainScreen.tsx) and never again — the one surface in the app that wasn't
 * live: a reply/DM/channel post/join-request arriving while the bell was already open stayed
 * invisible until the user closed and reopened it. This exercises the fix: the
 * `notifLiveRecompute` effect (see MainScreen.tsx, right before threadNodes) that re-derives on the
 * same storeVersions/feed/inbox signals the rest of MainScreen already recomputes on, for as long as
 * the center stays open — while staying gated on notifOpen and memoized on those exact keys so it
 * doesn't pay for a re-scan on every unrelated render or while the center is closed.
 *
 * EVERYTHING below runs against ONE mounted MainScreen tree, walking through the scenarios via
 * sequential tree.update() calls rather than one-mount-per-`it()`. That is deliberate, not just
 * economy: MainScreen has a pre-existing, already-known hazard where an unrelated effect
 * (useScrollChrome's Animated-driven task, independent of anything touched here) can leave a
 * stray InteractionManager task behind a torn-down tree, which then fires during a LATER tree's
 * render and crashes the whole jest worker (TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
 * (reading 'Value')) — see MainScreen.navOriginStack.test.tsx's afterEach comment for the same
 * failure mode. Mounting MainScreen more than once per file reliably reproduces it (confirmed
 * while writing this test). One mount, unmounted only once at the very end, sidesteps it entirely.
